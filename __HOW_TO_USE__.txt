* Mandelbrot Set Explorer by Clayton Jones *

Hello! Here is a tutorial on how to use my little mandelbrot explorer!

There are a few important keybindings:
    1. Click to zoom on a spot
    2. Use = and ] to increase or decrease the iterations, respectively
    3. Use x to generate a high-resolution render of your current screen (2000 by 2000)
        * This shows up under the main directory in the RENDEREDmandel.png file
    4. Use r to return the main mandelbrot set

Have fun with the explorer!
